//this sketch uses a lawn tractor to power 3 components
//1. at 12V it powers a 2 SPDT 10Amp Power Relay Module, DC 12V Version
//2. at 12V it powers a Chuangruifa 15W 12VDC to 5VDC
//3. at 12V it powers a linear actuator (BEMONOC DC 2 inch 12V linear actuator 50mm stroke 165lb heavey duty 10mm/s)
// at 5V the Chuangruifa powers the Arduino, 2 5V switches (I used switches with red and green LED lights)
// the Arduino reads the voltage at the switches to determine if they are on/off
// the Arduino sends 5V to either of the relays (one relay extends the actuator, the other retracts)
// the double relay module functions as a H-bridge to switch the polarity of the actuator and thus controls whether it extends or retracts
// two pull-down 10K Ohm resistors are used to keep the voltage at zero in the wires measuring voltage at the switches when they are off.
